		<div class="school"><img src="isc.jpg">
			<h3>Ideal School and Collge</h3><br>
			<p>Nothing to say about it as it introduced by its name. Total 10 years of life was almost ruined. Noting learned except how to torture a student.</p><br>
			<p>In spit of that, one persone whom I admire most. Our english teacher late Foez ahmed sir. Who was the best person of the earth.</p> 
		</div>

		<div class="college"><img src="dcc.jpg">
			<h3>Dhaka City College</h3><br>
			<p>Skill is everything here. From 1st day to last I was amazed to my college. Everything is well organized.</p><br>
			<p>I must mention that my largest friend circel is from my college. My class teacher was best at everything. this part of my life was a little bit interesting.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="univ"><img src="DU.jpg">
		<h3>University of Dhaka</h3><br>
		<p>I don't know why people along with their guardians are crazy about it. Actually as an insider found nothing like that except negativity of politics among so called brillian teachers and students. The only excellence is in the cultural programs.</p><br>
		<p>the transportation is really a relifable part of this life. Hall life is as enjoyable as ruinable. Last of all without job DU will never be favorable for you.</p>
